Encrypting a File with Python: pyAesCryp

The program is a Python script that uses the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) and the pyAesCrypt library to encrypt and decrypt text files. Hereâ€™s an overview of its main features:

Program Features

Graphical User Interface: It uses tkinter to provide a simple and intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily interact with the program without having to use the command line.

File Selection: The user can select a text file (.txt) to encrypt or decrypt using a file selection dialog. This file is displayed in the interface.

Encryption:

When the user enters a password and clicks the "Encrypt" button, the program uses the pyAesCrypt library to encrypt the selected file.
The encrypted file is saved with a .aes extension, keeping the original file intact.
Decryption:

If the user wants to decrypt an encrypted file, they can enter the password used for encryption and click the "Decrypt" button.
The program decrypts the file and saves the result with a .plain extension, indicating that the file has been restored to its original state.
Password Management: The password entered by the user is used for both encryption and decryption, ensuring that only those who know the password can access the original data.

How to Use the Program
Run the Program: Execute the Python file to open the graphical interface.

Select a File: Click the "Choose File" button to select the text file you want to encrypt or decrypt.

Enter the Password: Type in the password you want to use for encryption or decryption.

Encrypt or Decrypt: Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the file or the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the encrypted file.

Check the Results: After the operation, the encrypted or decrypted file will be available in the same directory as the original file.
